> [NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/) give users easy access to NVIDIA hosted API endpoints for NVIDIA AI Foundation Models like Mixtral 8x7B, Llama 2, Stable Diffusion, etc. These models, hosted on the [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/), are optimized, tested, and hosted on the NVIDIA AI platform, making them fast and easy to evaluate, further customize, and seamlessly run at peak performance on any accelerated stack.
> 
> With [NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/), you can get quick results from a fully accelerated stack running on [NVIDIA DGX Cloud](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/). Once customized, these models can be deployed anywhere with enterprise-grade security, stability, and support using [NVIDIA AI Enterprise](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/).
> 
> These models can be easily accessed via the [`langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints/) package, as shown below.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints
```

## Setup

**To get started:**

1. Create a free account with [NVIDIA](https://build.nvidia.com/), which hosts NVIDIA AI Foundation models

2. Click on your model of choice

3. Under `Input` select the `Python` tab, and click `Get API Key`. Then click `Generate Key`.

4. Copy and save the generated key as `NVIDIA_API_KEY`. From there, you should have access to the endpoints.

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

```python
from langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints import ChatNVIDIA

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="mixtral_8x7b")
result = llm.invoke("Write a ballad about LangChain.")
print(result.content)
```

## Using NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints

A selection of NVIDIA AI Foundation models are supported directly in LangChain with familiar APIs.

The active models which are supported can be found [in API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/).
